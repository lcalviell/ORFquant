\title{Select a subset of transcripts with Ribo-seq data}
\usage{
select_txs(region, annotation, P_sites, P_sites_uniq, junction_counts,
  uniq_signal = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{region}{genomic region being analyzed}

\item{annotation}{Rannot object containing annotation of CDS and transcript structures (see \code{prepare_annotation_files})}

\item{P_sites}{GRanges object with P_sites positions}

\item{P_sites_uniq}{GRanges object with uniquely mapping P_sites positions}

\item{junction_counts}{GRanges object containing Ribo-seq counts on the set of annotated junctions}

\item{uniq_signal}{Use only signal from uniquely mapping reads? Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
GRanges object with the set of counts on each exonic bin and junctions, together with the list
of selected transcripts
}
\description{
This function flattens all annotated transcript structures and uses Ribo-seq to select a subset of transcripts.
}
\details{
Features (bins and junctions) are divided into shared and unique features, and into with support and without
support (with  or without reads mapping). A set of logical rules filters out transcripts with internal features with no support
and no unique features with reads. More specific details can be found in the ORFquant manuscript.
