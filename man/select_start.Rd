\title{Select start codon}
\usage{
select_start(ORFs, P_sites_rle, cutoff = NA, cutoff_ave = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{ORFs}{Set of detected ORFs}

\item{P_sites_rle}{Rle signal of P_sites along the transcript}

\item{cutoff}{cutoff of total in-frame signal between start codons (sensitive to outliers). Defaults to NA}

\item{cutoff_ave}{cutoff for frequency of in-frame codons between two start codons (less sensitive to outliers). Defaults to .5}
}
\value{
Set of detected ORFs, including info about the possible longest ORF for that frame.
}
\description{
This function selects the start codon for ORFs in the same transcript
}
\details{
ORFs are divided based on stop codon and Ribo-seq signal between start codons is used to select one.\cr
When more than \code{cutoff_ave} fraction of codons is in-frame between two candidate start codons, the most upstream
is selected.
