\usage{
plot_ORFquant_results(for_ORFquant_file, ORFquant_output_file,
  annotation_file, coverage_file_plus = NA, coverage_file_minus = NA,
  output_plots_path = NA, prefix = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{for_ORFquant_file}{path to the "for_ORFquant" file containing P_sites positions and junction reads}

\item{ORFquant_output_file}{Full path to the "_final_ORFquant_results" RData object output by ORFquant. See \code{run_ORFquant}}

\item{annotation_file}{Full path to the *Rannot R file in the annotation directory used in the \code{prepare_annotation_files function}}

\item{coverage_file_plus}{Full path to a Ribo-seq coverage (no P-sites but read coverage) bigwig file (plus strand), as the ones created by \code{RiboseQC}}

\item{coverage_file_minus}{Full path to a Ribo-seq coverage (no P-sites but read coverage) bigwig file (minus strand), as the ones created by \code{RiboseQC}}

\item{output_plots_path}{Full path to the directory where plots in .pdf format are stored.}

\item{prefix}{prefix appended to output filenames}
}
\value{
the function exports a RData object (*ORFquant_plots_RData) containing data to produce all plots, and produces different QC plots in .pdf format.
The plots created are as follows:\cr\cr
\code{ORFs_found}: Number of ORF categories detected per gene biotype.\cr
\code{ORFs_found_pct_tr}: Distribution of ORF_pct_P_sites (% of gene translation) for different ORF categories and gene biotypes.\cr
\code{ORFs_found_ORFs_pM}: Distribution of ORFs_pM (ORFs per Million, similar to TPM) for different ORF categories and gene biotypes.\cr
\code{ORFs_found_len}: Distribution of ORF length for different ORF categories and gene biotypes.\cr
\code{ORFs_genes}: Number of detected ORFs per gene.\cr
\code{ORFs_genes_tpm}: Gene level TPM values, plotted by number of ORFs detected.\cr
\code{ORFs_maxiso}:  Number of genes plotted against the percentages of gene translation of their most translated ORF.\cr
\code{ORFs_maxiso_tpm}: Gene level TPM values, plotted against the percentages of gene translation of their most translated ORF.\cr
\code{Sel_txs_genes}: Number of genes plotted against the number of selected transcripts.\cr
\code{Sel_txs_genes_tpm}: Gene level TPM values, plotted against the number of selected transcripts.\cr
\code{Sel_txs_genes_pct}: Percentages of annotated trascripts per gene, plotted against the number of selected transcripts.\cr
\code{Sel_txs_bins_juns}: Percentages of covered exonic bins or junctions, using all annotated transcripts, coding transcripts only, or the set of selected transcripts.\cr
\code{Meta_splicing_coverage}: Aggregate signal of Ribo-seq coverage and normalized ORF coverage across different splice sites combinations, with different mixtures of translated overlapping ORFs.

\description{
This function produces a series of plots and statistics about the set ORFs called by ORFquant compared to the annotation.
IMPORTANT: Use only on transcriptome-wide ORFquant results. See \code{run_ORFquant}
